# Field Manager

### Overview
Fields are a method of creating inputs which are tied to each user. In other words, its a simple way to add fields which a user can user when he/she registers or updates their settings.

These could include fields such as phone numbers, addresses, invite codes, pin codes, birthday, links, dates, checkboxes, or a variety of others.

Just load up the FieldManager in the backend and define some fields, and their validation settings.

### Features
* Simple backend based field management
* Built in validation
* Currently 11 types of fields are supported with more to come soon
* Saved as JSON so the users table doesn't become crowded
* Optional (enabled by default) rendering of the fields via templates
* Optional encryption on a per field basis
* Optional class and placeholder overrides
* The ability to add any amount of additional attributes to the field as you need. Data attributes included.

### Use Cases

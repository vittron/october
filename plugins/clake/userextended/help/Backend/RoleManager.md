# Role Manager

### Overview
The Role Manager allows you to efficiently design groups with roles and add users to them. It's up to you to create functions for these roles and groups to access, but UE does have some built in such as:
* Route Restrictions via Roles or Groups

The Role Manager features a drag and drop or button use interface with 4 clean quadrants. Users can be promoted or demoted within a group as roles have an ordering. Users can only be a part of a single role within a group, but they can be a part of many groups.

### Features
* Pagination and Search for all 4 quadrants
* Drag n drop
* All group and role management can be done from this one central place
* Information and statistics about each role and group
* Promote and demote users within a group

### Use Cases
* A journalism website may use this to define a group of writers with many roles such as:
    * Student writer
    * Jr. Writer
    * Senior Writer
    * Editor
    
    and from this they would be able to set what type of writer role each user is.
